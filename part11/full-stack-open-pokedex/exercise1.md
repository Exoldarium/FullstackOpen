Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked? You can search for the answers by google.

Considering i use JavaScript and React at the moment i would use ESLint and Prettier for linting, Jest and React testing library for testing and Vite, Webpack or CRA for building.

What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions? Again, you can ask google!

Alternatives to Jenkins: Jira, Buddy
Alternatives to GitHub Actions: Azure pipelienes, GitLab

Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?

Jira and Buddy allow self-hosted environments, while Azure pipelines and Gitlab allow cloud based. Personally i would choose a cloud based environment as i am mostly working on my own projects so it would be easier to set up.
